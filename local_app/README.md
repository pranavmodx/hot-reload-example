# Electron-hot-boilerplate

This is a demo project for [electron-hot-loader](https://github.com/geowarin/electron-hot-loader).

It demonstrates that it is possible to hot reload (reload without losing state) React components in an electron
application without depending on babel or webpack.

## Redux

Since [version 0.5.0](https://github.com/geowarin/electron-hot-loader/releases), `electron-hot-loader` provides
a mechanism to watch higher-order components.

Check out [the redux branch](https://github.com/geowarin/electron-hot-boilerplate/tree/redux) for a demo, with reducers hot reloading!
